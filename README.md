A Flutter app I made to gain and learn more about Flutter and Dart, I learned in this project how to make the logic of the character movement and count player score and make enemy in the game.
Utilized Flutter's animation and physics capabilities to create smooth movements and realistic interactions.
Implemented an intuitive user interface with on-screen controls for seamless gameplay.
